title: Default Page
---

We can config the kind of a page
by setting the `kind` attribute at the beginning of page.

You do not have to set this attribute, because by default,
we will render a `DefaultPage`.

Note that a `title` attribute is still required.

```yaml
---
title: My First Page
---
Hello, World!
```
